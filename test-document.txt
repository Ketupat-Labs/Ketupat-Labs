Photosynthesis in Plants

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This process occurs primarily in the leaves of plants, specifically within specialized organelles called chloroplasts.

The Basic Equation
The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

This equation shows that carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light energy, are converted into glucose and oxygen.

Two Main Stages

1. Light-Dependent Reactions
These reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. They require light energy and produce ATP and NADPH, which are used in the next stage. Oxygen is released as a byproduct during this stage.

2. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
Also known as the Calvin cycle, these reactions occur in the stroma of chloroplasts. They use the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

Importance of Photosynthesis
- Produces oxygen that most living organisms need for respiration
- Creates the foundation of most food chains on Earth
- Removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
- Stores energy in the form of glucose and other organic molecules

Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
Several environmental factors can influence the rate of photosynthesis:
- Light intensity: More light generally increases the rate up to a certain point
- Carbon dioxide concentration: Higher CO2 levels can increase the rate
- Temperature: Optimal temperatures vary by plant species
- Water availability: Necessary as a raw material for the process

Chlorophyll
Chlorophyll is the green pigment in plants that absorbs light energy. There are different types of chlorophyll, with chlorophyll a and b being the most common in plants. These pigments absorb red and blue light most effectively, which is why plants appear green (green light is reflected).
